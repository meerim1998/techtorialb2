email = '''Frequently Asked Questions:

1 - Does my letter have to look exactly like yours?
No, but it does have to look roughly like a letter, including the box around the 
outside and the stamp.

2 - Do I have to use my real adress?
Of course not. But make sure that your fake address takes up three lines.

3 - How to I get a | to show up on the screen?
The | character is called a "pipe". Assuming you are using a normal US keyboard,
it is a Shift + backflash (\). The backslash key is usually located between the 
Backspace and Enter keys '''
